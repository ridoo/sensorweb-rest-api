### Overview

Next to the [Web API]({{site.baseurl}}/api.html), a Service Provider Interface (SPI) defines the 
underlying interface for data providing backends. With this, the API is flexible enough to
be put ontop of arbitrary data stores. Its modular design enables a seamless integration into 
existing Web applications.
